# Fullstack Weather Application

## üå§Ô∏è Overview

This is a fullstack weather application that displays current weather and forecast data for selected cities (Gliwice and Hamburg). It consists of:

- A **Node.js + Express** backend that fetches weather data from the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- A **React + Vite** frontend that presents the data in a clean and user-friendly interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Backend:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Axios (for external API calls)
- CORS

### Frontend:

- React
- Vite
- React Icons

### Data Source:

- [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

## How to Run the Application

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   cd backend
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Go to https://www.weatherapi.com and get your api key
4. Create 'apiKey' file in backend folder and paste your api key there
5. Start the backend server:
   node index.js

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   cd frontend
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the frontend development server:
   npm run dev

## Frontend-Backend Communication

- The frontend sends requests to the backend.
- The backend uses Axios to fetch real-time weather data from WeatherAPI.
- The backend then responds with parsed weather data, which the frontend displays.
